There is a lot of related work on the Graph500 benchmark and implementation of the breadth-first search algorithms. 

This paper, by Chaktranont et al.\cite{chakthranont2014exploring}, shows the difference between Graph500 benchmark on a virtual private cluster and on a physical cluster. The MPI implementation variant of the benchmark were used for these benchmarks.

A paper by Beamer et al.\cite{beamer2011searching} shows an improved algorithm for doing a breadth-first search. This algorithm is a hybrid, combining the top down approach with the bottom up approach.

Koji Ueno and Toyotaro Suzumura\cite{ueno2012highly} investigated the reference Graph500 implementation. They point out the flaws of the MPI-based implementations which all do 1D partitioning and propose a 2D solution. The paper shows the results of this implementation which performs better for larger scale problems.
