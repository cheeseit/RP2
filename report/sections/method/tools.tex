\subsubsection{Message Passing Interface and OpenMP}
\label{mpiopenmp}
``Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed by a group of researchers from academia and industry to function on a wide variety of parallel computers.\cite{mpi}''


``The OpenMP ARB mission is to standardize directive-based multi-language high-level parallelism that is performant, productive and portable''\cite{openmp}. In the Graph500 reference implementation OpenMP is often used to parallelize loops over multiple cores.

%TODO talk about buffer size, the way the graph is divided the compression used.

\subsubsection{Intel MPI Benchmark}
\label{tools-imb}
Intel MPI Benchmark(IMB) is used to get find out how well MPI performs in the setup. This is a free benchmark that can be used to measure the MPI functions on specific setups. The benchmark consists out of a few different test which all test a different aspect of MPI. Of the different test ``PingPong'' is one important to us. The ``PingPong'' is used to measure the start up and throughput of a single message sent between two processes\cite{img-userguide}.

 The program is compiled using the OpenMPI compiler, details of the compilation can be found in Appendix [reference compilation benchmark].
