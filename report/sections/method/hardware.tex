The goal of the project to do a Graph500 benchmark on the cloud and find out a model to predict the performance of the benchmark. For this a experiments were done on the DAS-4 to create a baseline. In the following sections the hardware used will be shown.
\subsubsection{Das-4}
\label{hw:das4}
The Distributed ASCI Supercomputer 4 (DAS) is a six-cluster wide-area distributed system designed by the Advanced School for Computing and Imagining (ASCI)\cite{das-4}. The six-clusters are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Vrije Univeristeit (VU)
\item Leiden Univeristeit (LU)
\item Univeristeit van Amsterdam (UvA) 
\item Technische Universiteit Delft (TUD)
\item Univeristeit van Amsterdam - The MultimediaN (UVA-MN) 
\item Astronomy institute Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON)
\end{itemize}
All computations have been done on the clusters from he VU and LU. These two clusters were chose because the cluster of LU is not actively in use and has the nodes with the most memory. The VU cluster was used, because it has the most machine available and has an OpenNebula cluster installed on it. The specifications of the clusters can be found in table \ref{tab:das-clusters}. 

Each of the nodes in the clusters has a dual quad-core processor with a speed of 2.4 GHz. All the nodes all also connected with InfiniBand\cite{infiniband}.
\begin{table}[!h]
	\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Cluster & Number of nodes  & Memory(GB) \\ \hline
VU 		& 74 (41) for all purposed	 & 24			\\ \hline
LU		& 16 & 48 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{The specifications of the clusters used in this project.}
\label{tab:das-clusters}
\end{table}
All nodes on the cluster have CentOS release 6.6 (Final) installed on them.


\subsubsection{OpenNebula}
\label{hw:opennebula}
``OpenNebula  provides the most simple but feature-rich and flexible solution for the comprehensive management of virtualized data centers to enable private, public and hybrid IaaS clouds. OpenNebula interoperability makes cloud an evolution by leveraging existing IT assets, protecting your investments, and avoiding vendor lock-in.''\cite{opennebula}. The version of OpenNebula(ON) installed on the VU cluster is version 3.8. The ON cluster used consisted of 8 nodes, the specs of these nodes are different from the other nodes in the cluster. Table \ref{tab:specs-opennebula}. For the experiments the following two templates were used seen in Appendix[Reference].
\begin{table} [!h]
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
		\hline
		CPU & Number of cores & RAM  \\ \hline
		Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620 0 2.00 GHz & 24 & 66 GB\\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{This table shows the specs of the nodes used on the DAS-4 to host OpenNebula. There were 8 of these nodes available.}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Amazon instances}
\label{hw:Amazon}
The machine used for the experiments are the c3.large and r3.large machines. This is a machine which is optimized to do computation. The reason c3.large specifically was chose is because this has just enough RAM to be able to run all the experiments(scale 24). The r3.large is a machine which is optimized for task which are memory intensive. The goal of choosing these two machines is to show what difference the machine makes on the performance of the program.

\begin{table}[!h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Type & vCPU & Mem GB & Processor \\ \hline
c3 & 2 & 4 & High Frequency Intel Xeon E5-2680 v2 (Ivy Bridge) Processors 2.80 GHz \\ \hline
r3 & 2 & 16 & High Frequency Intel Xeon E5-2670 v2 (Ivy Bridge) Processors 2.50 GHz \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
