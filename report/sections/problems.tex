There were some problems with running the \texttt{graph500\_mpi\_simple} on the DAS. The first problem was that the MPI version on the DAS-4. The version used is 1.4. This MPI 1.4 is not compatible with the reference code, which uses data types defined in later versions. Because of this the texttt{workaround.h} needed to be changed. Changing the file made it possible to compile this program on the DAS-4. In the commands of this file, it is stated that this would help out with the validation and will prevent the program from hanging. This was the case for a scale up to 15. At a scale higher than 15 program would get stuck while validating the first BFS. To avoid this problem, experiments have been run with validation turned off.
