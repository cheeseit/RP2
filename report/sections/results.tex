\subsection{OpenMP}
As mentioned before the implementation used is the simple implementation. First the OpenMP was tested. Figure [Graph showing graph generation] shows a graph of the amount of time spent generating the graph as a function of the amount of cores that were assigned to the program. As can be seen in the graphs the time spent creating the graph linearly dependent on the amount of CPUs that can be used by the program. 

In figure [OPENMP GTEPS] it can be seen that the amount of lines that can be traversed does not rely on the amount of CPUs that are available to the process.
