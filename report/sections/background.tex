An introduction to the background.
\subsection{MPI and OpenMP}

\subsection{Breadth-first Search}
Breadth-first search(BFS) is that way the Graph500 specifies the traversal of the graph. Although they specify this given there are multiple ways of actually traversing the graph and still return the BFS Graph.

\subsection{Kronecker graph}
The graph that is used by the Graph500 is the Kronecker graph\cite{leskovec2010kronecker}. This is because a Kronecker graph has some nice properties which are also seen in graph that can be seen in the real world.
%TODO list of properties which are important to the graph500.

\subsection{Graph compression}
Something about Sparse matrixes, because it is kroneck graph and ways of reducing the amount data needs to be stored while using such a graph.
