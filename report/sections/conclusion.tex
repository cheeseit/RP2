The research question for this project is as follows: \\
Is it possible to make a model that can predict the performance depending on the amount of resources? \\
To answer our main question, the following sub-questions have been formulated: 
\begin{itemize}
\item What size of graph is reasonable to benchmark while working on the cloud?
\item How well does the reference implementation\cite{graph500-code} run on the public cloud?
\item What model fits the results acquired from running the benchmark on the cloud?
\end{itemize}
