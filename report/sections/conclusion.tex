The project focused on finding a model to predict the performance of the a Graph 500 benchmark depending on the amount of resources.

A reasonable size of graph to process on Amazon EC2 is a scale of 30. Processing a scale 30 graph can  be done with 32 r3.large instance and takes for five hours to complete. Getting 32 instances of the r3.large on Amazon EC2 does not take a lot of effort.

The performance of the Graph 500 benchmark on the DAS-4 has been compared to the performance of the Amazon EC2. From the results we can conclude that the public cloud can be competitive with a super computer. Although there is no InfiniBand in the cloud, the latency and compute power of the machines is competitive with the DAS-4 in terms of performance.
 
A model has been created. This model is dependent on the tipping performance point. Before the point, the model is linear. After the tipping point, we approximate the model with a constant performance, which is an optimistic prediction. The parameters of this linear function are dependent on the architecture on which the benchmark is running.
