%TODO need to changed to better suit the results.
The research question for this project is as follows: \\
Is it possible to make a model that can predict the performance depending on the amount of resources? \\
To answer our main question, the following sub-questions have been formulated: 
\begin{itemize}
\item What size of graph is reasonable to benchmark while working on the cloud?
\item How well does the reference implementation\cite{graph500-code} run on the public cloud?
\item What model fits the results acquired from running the benchmark on the cloud?
\end{itemize}

The research will focus on running the Graph 500 MPI reference implementations. These implementations are created by the owners of the Graph 500 and there is no doubt that the implementations adhere to the specifications. The Graph500 times two kernels: the graph generation and the BFS. The focus of the project will be on the BFS. The BFS performance is the most important metric for the benchmark and is shown on the list.
