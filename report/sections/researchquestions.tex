%TODO need to changed to better suit the results.
The research question for this project is as follows: \\
Is it possible to make a model that can predict the performance depending on the amount of resources? \\
To answer our main question, the following sub-questions have been formulated: 
\begin{itemize}
\item What size of graph is reasonable to benchmark while working on the cloud?
\item How well does the reference implementation\cite{graph500-code} run on the public cloud?
\item How can this implementation be improved to get a better performance while running it on the cloud?
\end{itemize}

The research will focus on running the MPI Graph500 reference implementation. This is an implementation designed by them and there is no doubt that this implementation adheres to the specifications. Optimizations will only be done for running the implementation on the cloud.
The Graph500 times two kernels the graph generation and the BFS. The focus of the project will be on the BFS, because this is what is shown on the list. %TODO optimizations
