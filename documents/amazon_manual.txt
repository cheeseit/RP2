Need to make a security group to allow port 22 spefically otherwise it does not work.


example of logging in
ssh -i amazon_harm_dermois.pem ec2-user@54.154.219.176

Workflow amazon measurements

Create instances with install.py <nr  instance>
Wait a little to create the instance and run install.py again to get the host file
If the hosts file is filled move it to the code/shell
Add the right key to the ssh agent to reduce the amount of passwords that need to be filled in.
example
hdermois@desktop-36:~/Documents/RP2/code/shell$ ssh-agent bash
hdermois@desktop-36:~/Documents/RP2/code/shell$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Run prepare_amazon_vm.sh to get the latest code on the VMs and add the hostfile to the first node and get to know all the other servers.

ssh <firstnodein the hostfile> "<mpi command>"
example:
ssh root@123.111.222.111 "mpirun -np 2 -hostfile /root/hosts /root/project/code/graph500/mpi/graph500_mpi_simple 9 16"
Example with a loop
for i in 9 12 15 18 21 24; do ssh root@54.171.114.13 "mpirun -np 4 -hostfile /root/hosts /root/project/code/graph500/mpi/graph500_mpi_simple $i 16" 2> scale_"$i"_nodes_4.err 1> scale_"$i"_nodes_4.txt; done
