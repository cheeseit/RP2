A very indepth look into kronecker generator. Gives a good introduction and also explains the basic concepts of the model.
It also states some things which are not true anymore, but also shows to what properties a network should have. It also
compare the kronecker graph to other types of graphs. Lik bipartite graphs and edos renyi.

Some results about how the graph relates to real graphs. Find out how the stachastical graph is build up. 

Sudo code for kronfit.

Statistical kronecker graphs, tell you how they should be produced and keep the same degree of the graph. Probablity that each specified edge might appear.

Good visual reprensentation of the kronecker graphs which can be produced.

synomyns for kronecker product Kronecker product are tensor product, categorical product, direct product, cardinal product, 
relational product, conjunction, weak direct product or just product, and even Cartesian produc

This presentation gives an introduction into kronecker graphs and gives some example calculation.
It also states some things which are not true anymore, but also shows to what properties a network should adhere.
