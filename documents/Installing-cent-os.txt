To run mpi everything needs to be in the same place. So you need absolute paths for
each of the variables you are giving. The hosts files need to be in the same place
the executables need to be in the same place all. It also needs to be able connect 
to the other instances via ssh. So i created a key on the machine and add it's own 
public key to the authorized keys. So every clone of the machine will get the same stuff.
